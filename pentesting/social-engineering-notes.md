## What is social engineering?

Social engineering - an attempt of deception in order to obtain some confidential data with fraudulent intention.

It is one of the mot important attack vectors. Relies on human error. Causes devastating consequences.

Some concepts of **phishing**:
- People clicking on malicious links without any bad intention. Even though they were perticularly told not to;
- Social engineering may provide supply for targeted phishing - **spear phishing** - which uses some of private information, and is aimed on a particular person
- Phishing attacks are generally not recognised when they take place.

Social engineering attacks mostly rely on **emotions**:
- Greed
- Urgency
- Curiosity
- Fear
- Self interest
- Helpfulness

## How it works?

Malicious actors try to disguise message as urgent, dreadful or routine in order to force person to act without proper observation.

It strongly relies on emotions and pshycological manipulations:
- Authority
- Liking
- Reciprocation
- Concession
- Commitment and consistency
- Obligation
- Social validation (consensus, social proof)
- Scarcity

## It is not always employees' fault

Sometimes people may fall for social engineering attacks because there is a lack of policy or this policy is badly delivered or not enforced to employees

## How malicious actors gather information for an attack?
1. Open Source Intelligence (Google, social media, companies house, etc.)
2. From other people (phone calls, email, face-to-face)

## Types of social engineering attacks:

### Online
- Phishing
- Spear Phishing
- CEO Fraud (Impersonating of authority)
- Vishing/Smishing (Using phone or sms. Often tries to look scary, urgent and to cause panic)
- Scareware (It fakes antivirus or some other useful soft. Scares people to pay for removal of fake malware)
- Ransomware

### Offline
- Pretexting (lying in order to get confidential information. Usually requires pre-intelligence, e.g. identity confirmation)
- Bating (E.g. leave a usb stick in office with hope that someone will plug it in)
- Diversion Theft (Tricking courier to pick up or drop off a parcel at a wrong address)
- Quid pro quo (Attacker asks for help or to provide help. Makes victim feel obliged)
- Honey Trap (using sex as a tool to extract information. Now frequently used online. Fake relationships to get sensitive information)
- Tailgating (Follow a group. e.g. Rely on the person who holds the door open for the group)
