# Functions

## Function is a rule

Every function takes an input. Has a rule on how to process the input. For every input there is only one output

Function may be described as f(x) = x^2, where
- f is a name of the function
- x is an argument, an independent variable

### Functions may be composite

f(x) = 5x
g(x) = x^2
g(f(x)) = 25x^2

### Mathematically functions me be seen as a link between two set of numbers

- f: X -|-> 
- add_one: 1..5 -|-> 1..5 , function takes number and adds one

> There are domain and the range of the function:

dom add_one = {1,2,3,4} - 5 is not included

ran add_one = {2,3,4,5} - 1 is not included

### Partial and Total function

- Partial - not every element from the 'from set' maps to 'to set'. *dom x is a subset of X*
f: X -|-> Y

- Total - if all the numbers from 'from set' maps to all numbers from 'to set' this function is total
f: X -> Y

### Maplets may be used to define a function. Function is basically a set of maplets.

Maplet example : 3 |-> 4
Maplet is basically a rule for every particular input

3 |-> 4 is an element of add_one

add_one 3 = 4

## Relations

### Binary relations

Binary relation, R, from A to B associates elements of A to Elements of B

## Types of Functions:

1. Surjective (onto) - Every element of B is associated with some element of A

2. Injective (one-to-one) - no two elements of A assigned to same elements of B

3. Bijective (invertible) - No two elements of A are sent to to the same result and all elements of B are used up
