# Computer Misuse Act (1990)

## Components of a crime (Both are necessary)

- ***Actus Reus*** - there should be a physical action. Must always exist
- ***Mens Rea*** - there should be a malicious intent

### Mens Rea

- Mens Rea - a guilty intention or some level of thought involved
- From a subjective or objective perspective
- Often somewhere in between
- Sufficient presence ultimately decided by a judge or jury
- Not mathematical
- Quite a qualitative excersice 

## CMA 1990 5 offences

1. Unathorised **access** to computer material (aka 'Hacking')
2. Unathorised access with **intent** to commit or facilitate commision of **further offences**
3. Unathorised acts with **intent to impair**, or with **recklessness** as to imparing, operation of computer, etc.
3. A) Making supplying or obtaining articles for use in offence under section 1 or 3
3. ZA) Anauthorised acts causing, or creating risk of, serious damage

## Instigation of the CMA 1990

- Royal Family vs Gold and Schifreen
- Culprits got access to prince Phillip's Prestel account by shoulder surfing BT engineer ar a conference
- It wasn't a theft, fraud, blackmail. It was a new offence. Solution - CMA 1990

## Recklessness or Intent?

- S.3 uses the term 'recklessness' to describe the level of thought required for mens rea
- Other sections require intent

### Recklessness

- R v. Caldwell [1982] AC-341:
>        If a reasonable man would have realised what would happen then the accused should have and would therefore be guilty
- Obvious Risk
- Not giving any thought of possibility of risk
- Recognising it and going on nonetheless to do it
- R v. G [2003] UKHL 50, ojective view might be unfair. Mens rea for recklessness should be taken subjectevely
- Places empahasis upon whether in the circumstances known to the particular defendant it was unreasonable to do the thing.

### Criminal Stnadard of Proof - BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT

## What is a Computer?

- CMA purposely does not define to allow for technological development
- DPP v. McKeown and, DPP v Jones [1997] defined a computer as:
>        'A Device for storing, processing and retrieving information'
- includes ***ad Infinitum***
> TV, baby monitor, key fob, smart loo, fridge, watch, etc...
